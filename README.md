## Bonn Lean seminar, summer semester 2026

This is the repository for the advanced Lean seminar at university Bonn.
This page is currently under construction; an outline of the seminar will follow soon.

**Prerequisites.** Lean knowledge at the level of e.g. the lecture "Topics in Computer-assisted
Mathematics" in WiSe25/26 ([course page](https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse25)). If you have not used Lean before, I recommend you to take a class on it first. The above lecture will be offered again next winter semester.
If you have used Lean, but are unsure about your knowledge, feel free to write me an email (rothgang at math.uni-bonn.de).

**Initial meeting.** Thursday, February 12 at 10.15 (room 0.011).

**Regular seminar time and place**: Tuesdays, 14.15 to 15.45 (room N.008 --- in the *Neubau* building behind the main mathematics building)
