# Bonn Lean seminar, summer semester 2026

This is the repository for the advanced Lean seminar at university Bonn.

**Prerequisites.** Lean knowledge at the level of e.g. the lecture "Topics in Computer-assisted
Mathematics" in WiSe25/26 ([course page](https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse25)). If you have not used Lean before, I recommend you to take a class on it first. The above lecture will be offered again next winter semester.
If you have used Lean, but are unsure about your knowledge, feel free to write me an email (rothgang at math.uni-bonn.de).

**Initial meeting.** Thursday, February 12 at 10.15 (room 0.011).

**Regular seminar time and place**: Tuesdays, 14.15 to 15.45 (room N.008 --- in the *Neubau* building behind the main mathematics building)

**Outline and topics**: see [here](Plan.pdf)

## Tentative schedule
Some details are subject to change: a few talks need to be scheduled, for example.

- **April 14.** equality, transparency and all that (Fridolin)
- **April 21.** unification (Max)
- **April 28.** typeclass inference, part 1 (Jasper)
- **May 5.** typeclass inference, part 2 (Alex)
- **May 12.** no seminar

- **June 16.** the `gcongr` tactic (Pascal)
- **June 23.** no seminar
- **June 30.** no seminar

**Not yet scheduled** are talks by
- *Johannes* on verbose lean (and perhaps waterproof)
- *Yannik* on the `aesop` tactic
- *Pablo* about the *flypitch* project and model theory

There will be a poll for finding suitable dates soon.
